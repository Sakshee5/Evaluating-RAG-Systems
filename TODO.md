- maybe i dont need to save session id for the data models (think it thru)
- if i upload, delete and upload again, it doesnt show on the UI?
- maybe add a max of 3 configs

- when i open the application, if file not found, then don't display the docs/question/configuration tab. Then only provide option to create a new session
- if file available, pre-fill the documents, questions and configurations on the UI based on the retrieved session
- only activate the "Proceed to Evaluation" button if atleast one doc, one config and one question has been entered. When "Proceed to evaluation" is pressed. simple redirect to Eval tab.

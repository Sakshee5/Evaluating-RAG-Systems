- maybe i dont need to save session id for the data models (think it thru)
- if i upload, delete and upload again, it doesnt show on the UI?
- maybe add a max of 3 configs

- when i open the application, if file not found, then don't display the docs/question/configuration tab. Then only provide option to create a new session - working but still shows session id at hte top and 500 fetch request error
- if file available, pre-fill the documents, questions and configurations on the UI based on the retrieved session

- ask for API key conditionally depending on the model being used
- forget evaluate results for now! can do judge stuff when i get sometime
- answer can be completely across the length of the card. view chunks and visualizarion can be beside each other. each chunk has a card similar to how we have right now but the chunk text can appear if you hover your mouse on the chunk instead of having it all displayed since the chunk can be huge
- PNG display not currently working
- implement caching when the document is already processed
